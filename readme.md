# Brutalize my web page

*This project is inspired by an article I read by
[Christian Miller](https://medium.com/attack-the-front/how-to-brutalize-the-web-e06b22f7de57#.efdxzxlkh).*


**Brutalism** is recognised by most as an movement that dispays a style which is raw, rugged & functional.
Most commonly it has been assosiated with a style of architecture which was phased out by the late 1980's.

In my own inpretation, I see it as an unconventional attraction to what is commonly known to be "ulgy."
After all beauty and ugliness are purely subjective descriptions of form and as the well known proverb goes -

>Beauty is in the eye of the beholder

As an aspiring Front End Dev & UX / UI designer myself I spend hours trying to get balance, order and design to harmoniously tie together.
I try to create simple and what I hope would be widely recognised by most as beautifully designed websites, applications,
interfaces or other forms of digital media.

I enjoy and love to create but sometimes it can be just as joyeous to destroy this idea, to take it apart and decontruct this societal point of view.


**The aim of this project** is to take something that you or a UI / UX designer meticulously crafted and throw it into a chaotic, archaic
state. Hopefully from this randomness and loss of control something as apealling will be created
OR at least some fragment of the choas will inspire you to create and invent something new and unexpected.
